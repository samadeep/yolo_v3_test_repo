#  YOLO V3 Object Detection on Images

Import necessary libraries: 
The code starts by importing the required libraries, including cv2 for image processing and numpy for numerical operations.

- Load YOLO: 
The YOLO weights and configuration files are loaded using the cv2.dnn.readNet function. The yolov3.weights file contains the pre-trained weights of the YOLO model, and yolov3.cfg specifies the network architecture. The coco.names file contains the class names that the YOLO model is trained to detect.

- Load the image:
The code loads the input image using the cv2.imread function and stores it in the image variable.

- Preprocess the image: 
The image is resized to a fixed size of (416, 416) pixels, which is the input size expected by the YOLO network. The image is also normalized by dividing the pixel values by 255.0 to bring them in the range of 0 to 1. These preprocessed image data are stored in a blob (Binary Large Object) format using the cv2.dnn.blobFromImage function.

- Forward pass through the network: 
The preprocessed image blob is passed through the YOLO network using the net.setInput function. The network performs a forward pass, which generates predictions for object detections. The output of the network is obtained using the net.forward function and stored in the outs variable.

- Process detections: 
The code iterates over the output layers of the YOLO network and the detections made by each layer. For each detection, the code extracts the class scores, identifies the class with the highest score (class_id), and checks if the confidence of the detected class exceeds a threshold (here, 0.5).

- Extract object information: 
If the confidence is above the threshold, the code calculates the bounding box coordinates of the detected object based on the center coordinates, width, and height values provided by the YOLO network.

- Apply non-maximum suppression:
Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied to remove duplicate and overlapping bounding box detections. The cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes function takes the bounding boxes, confidences, and a specified threshold value. It returns the indexes of the bounding boxes that should be kept after the suppression.

- Draw bounding boxes and labels: 
The code iterates over the remaining bounding box indexes after NMS and draws rectangles around the objects on the image using the cv2.rectangle function. It also writes the class label and confidence value on the image using the cv2.putText function.

- Display the result: 
Finally, the resulting image with the bounding boxes and labels is displayed using the cv2.imshow function. The code waits for a key press (cv2.waitKey(0)) and then closes the displayed image windows (cv2.destroyAllWindows()).
